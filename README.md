PWM and GPIO circuit for motor control box

The pulse width modulation and general purpose input/output circuit goes with our proxy motor control box circuit, which is used for
switching between manual and automatic control of the bicycle. The program is run on LPC Expresso IDE and requires a few pins on the 
LPC 1769 board. The c file, "test_pwm.c" was used for this portion.


Website for phone connection using wifi

There will be a router mounted onto the bicycle for wifi connection. Having a router will give us a kill switch to the bicycle as an ultimate
safety feature.
